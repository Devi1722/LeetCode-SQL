# Question
https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

# Solution
SELECT contest_id, ROUND((COUNT(contest_id)/(SELECT COUNT(user_id) from Users) * 100),2) AS percentage
FROM Users u
JOIN Register r USING(user_id)
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC


# Explanation
# Specifically, the issue lies with COUNT(u.user_id).
# When used within the same grouping context as COUNT(r.contest_id),
# it does not give the total number of users but instead counts the number of users associated with each contest registration. 
# This results in an incorrect denominator for the percentage calculation.
